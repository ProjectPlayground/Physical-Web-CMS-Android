# Physical Web Content Manager
The aim of this project is to implement a backend for museums and exhibits that utilizes
Physical Web technology. The backend will allow visitors to access information about exhibit
pieces without the need to install any apps. Physically, this will be accomplished using
Eddystone beacons located near each piece. We focus on developing the software side used to
configure these beacons.

To achieve this, we will create an Android App that allows museum curators to configure the
Physical Web beacons they want to deploy and then upload the content that will be served. The
app will support combinations of text, images, audio and video. It will use Google Drive API for
its storage backend. The app will also allow the curators to create a map of the exhibition and
the beacons deployed, with the map also being stored on Google Drive. The app will also
support storing multiple entire configurations (a map and its associated beacon content) so that
the end-user can quickly deploy the content they need when exhibits change.
